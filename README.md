ABOUT THE TO DO LIST APP!

This React app uses form and list components to manage items like shopping list or task list.

State Management:
A state object called items is defined using useState. This object contains the text entered by the user (inputText) and a list of added items 

handleChange Function:
Listens for the text entered by the user in the input field on the form and updates the inputText value.

addItem Function:
Adds the text entered by the user to the list of existing items and clears the input field.

Components:
Heading: Header component
Form: Form component that allows the user to enter text and add items

List: Component that lists the added items.
This structure is a good example to demonstrate complex state management and data flow between components in React.
